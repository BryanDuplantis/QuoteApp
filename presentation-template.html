          Project Goals:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I wanted to create a responsive, mobile-first single-page app demonstrating skills in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript, using the popular JavaScript library jQuery and Bootstrap as a framework.
          </li>
          <li>
            I placed a strong emphasis on having a web-ready app, accessible online and in place for all of you this morning.
          </li>
          <li>
            But by all means, I wanted to challenge myself and have fun along the way. And it was both!
          </li>
        </ul>

          Demo
        </h3>
        <p>
          Time for a live demo!

        <h3>
          Lessons Learned:
        </h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Push your boundaries, stay disciplined & focused, but don't bite off more than you can chew (unless it's a donut; then go for it.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Make sure you READ THE DOCS. They are an indispensable resource and essential to any project. This can't be emphasized enough.
          </li>
          <li>
            The biggest lesson I learned: I was more capable than I thought! Oh, and you can't break anything - it's only the internet.
          </li>
        </ul>
